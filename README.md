# Emotion Detection

This project serves as an capstone endeavor undertaken to advance towards achieving my MIT Applied Data Science certification.

## 📃Description

A multi-class classification model that attempts to detect sad/happy/suprised/nuetral emotions on different faces.

## 🏫 What Did I Learn

* Retraining models used for transfer learning led to a lot better results.  I was getting great results from VGG16 doing that but due to time and contraints I removed the experiment.  But I will keep that little bit of knowledge here.
* Transfer learning did not guarantee automatic awesome accuracies.
* Grayscale vs RGB did not make a huge difference.
* There's not a lot of EDA with the data for the CNN models but augementing and flipping the images yielded better accuracies.

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

* A basic CNN model performed better than transfer learning in this case.


### 😤 Where I Got Stuck

* Trying to use transfer learning with the EfficientNet Model and get acceptable results was futile 😢

### ☑️ Todos...

* Present my findings
* Get MIT Applied Datascience Certificate
  
### 📖 Dataset

* I was given a zipfile with 15,109 training images, 128 testing images, and 4,977 validation images.  They are all located on my Google Drive.
